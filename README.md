# PokerHandUtils

Library of Solidity code to evaluate a 5 card poker hand.
Used as an exercise in non-trivial solidity development.
This is still a work in progress and can definitely be improved, optimized, and bugs may occur.

### Overview

Library for handling of poker hands consisting of cards numbered 0-51
Ace = 0, King = 12 in the suits Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades

Function: 	
evaluateHand takes a list of 5 cards (0-51)

Returns:
enum of Hand type and up to 5 values of the cards sorted to break ties

Notes: 		
State of the art poker hand evals use data tables and hash to run fast.
For in contract, wanted an old school analytic approach with low memory or external data
Return list of cards for tie breaker is pretty basic and could be updated easily to a hash value

### Usage

    int8[5] memory hand = [ int8(PokerHandUtils.CardId.Six_Clubs), int8(PokerHandUtils.CardId.Three_Clubs), int8(PokerHandUtils.CardId.Jack_Diamonds), int8(PokerHandUtils.CardId.Two_Clubs), int8(PokerHandUtils.CardId.Seven_Clubs)];
    PokerHandUtils.HandEnum handVal;
    int8[5] memory result;
    (handVal, result) = poker.evaluateHand(hand);

Example returns:
    (HandEnum.HighCard, [Jack, Eight, Six, Three, Two])

This project and uses [truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) Ethereum smart contracts development framework. In order to run it, install truffle first:

    npm install -g truffle

### Running tests

To run all of the smart contract tests use following command in your console:

    truffle test
